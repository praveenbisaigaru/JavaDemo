	/* 1. The access specifiers can be used to define the level of accessibility
	 * of either the member in the class/interface or the level of accessibility
	 * of a class/interface in a package.
	 * 2) using the access specifiers we can define the scope of a class/interface or its members and provide security.
	 * 3) The java language provides 4 levels of access specifiers with three keyword.
	 * 
	 * 1) public  (class, interface, variables, methods and constructors)
	 * 2) private  (variables, methods and constructors)
	 * 3) protected (variables, methods and constructors)
	 * 4) default  (class, interface, variables, methods and constructors)
