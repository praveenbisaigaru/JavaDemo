	 *  Abstract Class:

	 * In an abstract class we can have a abstract methods and methods with definition(concrete methods)
	 *  but its not mandatory to have abstract method in a abstract class.
	 * (For abstract classes we can create a reference variables but not an object of abstract class.  or an abstract class can not be instantiated, 
	 * which means you are not allowed to create an object of it. or  We cannot create an object for an abstract classes.)
	 * A class derived from the abstract class must implement all those methods that are declared as abstract in the parent class
	 * Abstract methods implementation will be written in the child class/derived class/sub class.
	 *
	 *Abstract method 
	 * In abstract methods we only have declaration but not definition(no body).
	 * Abstract methods should end with semicolon(;)
	 * If we have one abstract method in a class our class should be changed to abstract.
	 * A class has to be declared abstract to have abstract methods.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Note
	 * An abstract class can only have concrete methods
	 * For design purpose a class can be declared as abstract even if it 
	   doesn't contain any of the abstract methods).
	 * Reference of an abstract class can point to objects of its sub- classes thereby achieving run- time polymorphism.
	 * A class must be compulsory labeled abstract , if it has one or more abstract methods
	 * It can have constructors and static methods 
	 
	 * Concrete class:
	 * If all your methods are normal methods(methods which has definition and declaration) in a class then those classes are called as concrete classes.
	 * abstract class(concrete+abstract methods)
	 * abstract method(only declaration)
	 * concrete class(concrete+abstract methods)
	 * concrete method(declaration and definition)(with body)
